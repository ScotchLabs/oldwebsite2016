      <h3>Emily Broude</h3>
      <p>Hi everyone! For those of you who don’t know me, I’m Emily, a rising sophomore studying 

mechanical and biomedical engineering here at our fine institution. Even though I’ve only been here 

a year, I have a lot of experience with Scotch’n’Soda. I’ve been a tech head four times over, 

including for Tisbert; been on crews in every tech area; participated in NPP workshops and (badly) 

filmed their shows; and assistant stage managed Legally Blonde, which was easily one of the most 

rewarding experiences of my life so far.

I know that the position of Executive Board Member is a pretty nebulous one, but I’m excited to have 

the chance to take it on next year. Mid-production surveys and town halls are often overlooked, but 

to me they’ve become an incredibly valuable part of each production and semester that I’d love to be 

able to keep growing.

As a freshman, I know that entering this org can be a pretty overwhelming experience—you blink 

and all of a sudden you’re the sound board op for Halloween slot—and for some of us, getting 

thrown under the right bus with the right people beside us gives us the chance to fall in love with the 

org and learn at an exponential rate.

But for some, this learning curve is too much, or the way they’ve fallen into the org leaves them 

stuck in one position with no sense of how to learn something different. Whether it be acting, a tech 

area, or even a position on production staff that leaves someone in a rut, everyone in Scotch’n’Soda 

should be able to easily transition between sides of a production and learn about new areas that 

they’re interested in or just don’t know anything about.

This is the part where I start to have ideas, so bear with me. What I’d like to take on as my project as 

your EBM is the creation of an organized mentorship system, where members of S’n’S who love this 

org as much as I do can share their love with new or even longtime members, giving everyone the 

chance to see a new side of what we do.

Through something as simple as a Google form sent out twice a semester (because who doesn’t 

love Google forms?) and a meeting for coffee, new members can learn about what it’s like different 

aspects of a Scotch production without being thrown under that metaphorical bus. Someone who 

has experience acting could learn about being props master, or a Tisbert writer could learn about 

stage management—all with the added benefit of forging connections between members of the org 

who might not otherwise interact and giving our new members a friendly face to say hello to at the 

black chairs.

I’d really love the opportunity to have a greater role in Scotch next year, both as your EBM and a 

general board member—I have a lot of plans for where this org can go and I’m excited to get started 

on all of them. I think I’ll be a steady and unbiased voice on the board, not to mention that my 

original home in S’n’S is in tech, an area that’s traditionally underrepresented on the board and 

deserves a louder voice.

If you have any questions, comments, concerns, thoughts, ideas, general shenanigans, or just want 

to say hi, feel free to reach out to me at ebroude@andrew.cmu.edu or 914-980-3483, or just stop me 

on campus. I’m looking forward to working with you all next year in whatever capacity I can!</p>

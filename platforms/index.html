      <h3>Grace Lazos</h3>
      <p>This year, we have have made vast improvements in our leadership system, our social 

dynamics, and our overall outlook as an organization. My appreciation and admiration for our 

members’ hard work and dedication has only multiplied as I have watched us grow back to an 

organization of friendship and comradery. We are back on an upswing, and if elected President 

for the 2016-17 school year, I intend to keep us on that path. <br>

There are three main points I will focus on: <br>

● support of membership<br>

● collaboration on campus <br>

● community outreach. <br>

Support of Membership <br>

Our President for this past year, Geneva Jackson, had wonderful organizational tactics 

for our Weekly Meetings and direct communication with our membership. I fully plan on keeping 

her outlined agendas for Weekly Meetings and weekly office hours, but with the addition of two 

aspects: Suggestion Box Discussion and Weekend Office Hours. 

Suggestion Box Discussion would be at the end of each weekly meeting as a part of the 

President’s Board Member Update, and essentially would bring to the attention of the Board 

(and whomever else was in attendance) a submitted suggestion from that week. As 

communication with the general membership is the primary job of the Executive Board Member, 

choosing the suggestion(s) each week could also be a part of their responsibilities.  This will 

encourage our members to use the Suggestion Box more, and give the Board a more direct line 

to our members. <br>

Weekend Office Hours are just another way of providing our members with an 

opportunity to communicate their ideas and concerns. I learned from serving as Vice President 

of Membership for Sigma Alpha Iota-  Alpha Mu Chapter, that providing a number of shorter, 

spread out times for larger groups of people tends to work better than one designated, longer 

time a week. So I would be providing 1.5 hour slots on a few different times of day both during 

the week and on the weekend, so there are more opportunities for the organization to voice their 

thoughts, without the intimidating factor of a scheduled, one on one meeting. 

Lastly, I want to ensure that our members are educated and informed on the structural 

and for lack of a better term, political aspects of our organization. We offer overviews on our 

Board Positions at the beginning of the school year, and then have an Elections Process 

meeting in preparation for the end of the year, but I think that providing more detail and giving 

more advance will promote board transparency and make for a well informed organization. I 

intend on accomplishing this through a “Note from the President” once a month, each month on 

a different aspect. The first of the year after the General Body Meeting would be a “Meet the 

Board!” piece, naming each Board Member and listing their specific responsibilities. The next 

month would be on the Aux Board, and so on. The next semester would be more information on 

the Elections Process and Constitutional information, to prepare early and thoroughly for the 

end of the year elections. <br>

Collaboration on Campus <br>

We began to take on more outside projects this year, with Zahra Center and Polkadots: 

The Cool Kids Musical. This was exciting, and for the most part, successful. I think it is 

important for Scotch’n’Soda to collaborate with other student organizations on campus, in 

mutually beneficial ways, so we form ties and gain support from our campus community. We 

have discussed collaborating with Allies to put on a Drag Show in the past, but we were 

inhibited by time and resource constraints. Beginning this process earlier, and taking steps to 

educate their membership to work with our resources, would take the stress off our membership 

and create a much more enjoyable project. We have a large group of people who may not have 

the time or know-how to work on mainstage productions, so providing smaller-scale, skill-

building board projects would be a great teaching opportunity, and we are a teaching 

organization. This would be something I would be working over the summer to plan, reaching 

out to different heads of student organizations, so we are not rushed to pick a weekend at some 

time with two weeks notice. The rushed nature of our previous projects is where we found a lot 

of stress and lack of volunteers, so by taking early initiative, we can eliminate some of that 

stress. <br>

Community Outreach <br>

There are a number of other universities and amateur theatre companies in our area and 

greater Pittsburgh. I have already reached out to members of the University of Pittsburgh 

theatre group, to brainstorm ideas for future collaboration with their organization. I also plan on 

reaching out to students at Point Park, and educators/employees at Pittsburgh Civic Light Opera 

and CAPA. This would be primarily on a social basis at first, organizing events such as inviting 

the University of Pittsburgh students to our Labor Day BBQ, making plans to attend their shows 

and inviting them to ours, scheduling workshops or masterclasses with the more professional 

organizations. This is something I would collaborate with the General Membership Coordinator 

on, as well as the social committee. The more we reach out, the more resources we will have, 

and more opportunities to put Scotch’n’Soda on the map. <br>

In conclusion, my primary goal with all of these proposed projects, is to be the best face 

of the organization I can be. This group has done so much for me over the past three years, I 

am always happy to give back in any way that I can. I am so glad I have had the experiences I 

did in this organization, because every single one of them has helped me grow as a person, and 

taught me how to be a more effective leader. I have loved dedicating my time to Scotch’n’Soda. 

I elected to be here, and I hope you will elect me. Thank you.</p>

      <h1>VP Platforms</h1>
      <h3>Tina Vaz</h3>
      <p>Hi scotchlings! I’m Tina Vaz, a sophomore math major who happens to have a 

theatre problem and I want to be your next Vice President. <br>

I’ve been involved in Scotch’n’Soda since GBM my freshmen fall. I remember 

making the decision to join S’n’S during orientation. It was the casino night and I was 

wandering aimlessly, as I couldn’t find someone to hang out with. One of my OCs saw 

me and invited me over to talk to her friends, all of whom I later learned were S’n’S 

members. That night was one of my favorite nights of orientation. The upper classmen 

who I talked to made me feel so welcome and encouraged me to pursue the technical 

areas of theatre that I was interested in. Later I learned that most of them were actors and 

board members. They didn’t care that I was going to be a part of the tech side of S’n’S, 

they just saw me as a CMU student who was trying to find friends. <br>

So why tell this story? Over the past two years, I noticed that not everyone was as 

welcomed into S’n’S by people of different areas. Tech and acting have this huge divide 

that I am really disappointed by. Tisbert, NPP and Workshopping members can go all 

year without meeting people who do main stage shows. I have listened to tech 

complaining about actors messing up without even knowing who the actor is and the fact 

that they might have had a horrible day. The same goes for actors, where they will blame 

the sound crew for messing up during a run without knowing that this is the first show 

they’ve done and the first time they have had access to the sound board. NPP shows get 

scheduled during other shows and rehearsals. Tisbert doesn’t get as much attendance as it 

could if the entire org showed up. Sometimes, Workshopping gets forgotten as a part of 

our org. While some issues are unavoidable, the reactions throughout the org as a result 

of these are not. <br>

Throughout the last two years, I have worked as a props master, a house manager 

and been on pretty much every crew at least once. I actively try to meet the actors when I 

work on a show. I try to go to every Tisbert show and NPP show. I’ve been to 

workshopping events. I am always amazed at the dedication and energy that people put 

into this org, yet I am also astounded that they don’t put energy into meeting people who 

do different things in S’n’S. We are all members of the org that describes itself as “a 

social group with a theatre problem,” yet I think we’ve lost this over the past few years. 

You may be thinking, but what else does the VP do? Well, besides achieving 

personal goals, the VP is in charge of room reservations for the year and working with 

the sub troupes. Can Tina reserve a room? Yes, I can do this. What if something goes 

wrong? I am on good terms with the UC staff, and I believe that I can communicate 

effectively with them if things ever take a turn for the worse. Ok, but what about the sub 

troupes? I have a great appreciation for what they do and I will actively work to 

communicate with the aux board to know and understand the challenges they face and 

how to most effectively deal with them. <br>

In conclusion, I believe that I would be a good Vice President. I am passionate 

about this org and I am driven to make it be as unified as we can be. I believe that my 

ability to separate my personal and professional lives, communicate effectively and 

empathize with others will help me become an effective and successful board member. I 

miss the warm, openness of upper classmen who helped a scared, lonely freshmen 

become the loud, obnoxious Tina you know (and hopefully kind of like?). I have made no 

other commitments besides classes, and I know I can handle the time commitment. If I 

were elected, I would put my heart and soul into making S’n’S become more unified as a 

whole. <br>

<p>Our subtroupes and Auxiliary Board have made impressive strides in strengthening their

membership and individual projects. If elected as Vice President for the upcoming 2016-17 

school year, I will work to ensure the continuation of the strong bond between the general 

organization and these branches, as well as work to create programs and plans to support the 

future of our organization. <br>

The board has discussed adding a new member to the Auxiliary Board similar to the Director of 

Technical Training, a Director of Artistic Training. The position would essentially be to help train 

new directors and actors in the organization, running a New Director Workshop once a 

semester, very similar to the one Sophia Emmanuel created during the 2014-15 school year. 

The premise was creating directing pairs of new interested directors, and pairing them with a 

directing mentor to work on a scene. My thought is to take this model, and to pair it with an 

excellent idea that Brianna Hudock had and shared with me: to have the Workshopping 

committee have a showcase at the end of each semester to display the new works created. The 

new directors would be assigned a scene written by one of our workshoppers halfway through 

the program, after receiving background instruction on the different aspects of directing a show. 

The Director of Artistic Training would also schedule a series of acting workshops for 

prospective new actors, to prepare them to audition for the scenes. About halfway through the 

semester, the new directors would be assigned a scene written by the workshoppers, and would 

hold auditions. This would be a smaller-scale, lower-stakes way of training new directors and 

actors for the organization, so the same people do not keep directing, and our actors do not get 

burned out. <br>

In a similar vein, this sort of program implementation could be used by the Director of 

Technical Training. We had different presentations this year from all areas of tech, both design 

and implementation, but they only offered one opportunity, and little hands-on experience. In 

this model, the prospective tech heads in each area would be assigned a show, and would have 

a team of one person from each area designing an overall cohesive concept for their assigned 

production. For implementation, obviously large-scale sets and props could not be built, but 

smaller models/deliverables could be created and displayed in the case on the second floor of 

the UC. <br>

We are primarily a teaching organization, and by giving more opportunities to learn and 

develop skills will keep us functioning smoothly for years to come. It is incredibly gratifying to 

display newly developed skills and well done work, so providing an outlet for every one of our 

subtroupes and programs to be highlighted in is a great way to show appreciation for our 

membership.</p>

      <h1>GMC Platforms</h1>
      <h3>Heather Graci</h3>
      <p>I got to CMU in September and went to the fall GBM, and was instantly intimidated by the overwhelming amount of love in the room. Everyone seemed to know and genuinely enjoy each other already, and in most other groups of people, that makes it extremely difficult for new members to start feeling comfortable. In my past experiences with joining clubs and organizations and the like, groups tend to be inherently exclusive -- people gravitate towards the friends they already have, and newbies are left to fend for themselves. This experience was the polar opposite. Scotch‘n’Soda may truly be the most welcoming organizations I’ve ever been a part of. Older members told me to audition for shows and go to NPP workshops having barely even met me, told me all about their own experiences with the organization, and went out of their way to say hi to me around campus (and saved AnnaJamieson Beck and I when we got hopelessly lost in the middle of the night on our first weekend here -- we are forever in Darrin Willis’ debt).  This is the epitome of what I love about S’n’S. The org harbors a very genuine “all for one and one for all” mentality, which is an incredibly special thing to be a part of.<br>

This is the main reason I’m running for GMC. Scotch‘n’Soda is genuinely the reason I’ve had such a wonderful first year at CMU, and I want to help maintain that experience for both current and future members. Serving as GMC of the org would give me the opportunity to help foster the welcoming, loving atmosphere which is the main reason I spend an embarrassingly large number of hours at black chairs every day. It’s extremely important to me that new members feel as welcome and encouraged as I did when I first got here, as well as that existing members continue to feel valued and embraced by the organization. <br>

I’m very comfortable with public speaking and I love engaging with people one on one, so I feel like I have a lot to offer in terms of connecting with and recruiting new members. The relationships I’ve formed with existing members of the org will also help me in taking on this position, as I have access to a wide variety of opinions and experiences regarding what they value about S’n’S. I know how to make people feel comfortable, I’ve never been described as shy, and I love bringing people together. Between my specific qualifications and my connections within S’n’S, I genuinely feel that I have a lot to bring to the table in order to make the org even better than it already is. As much as I joke around and have fun, making sure things run smoothly and efficiently is extremely important to me. Hence, event organization can be very high stress, but I love doing it and things generally work out well. I’d love to organize even more organization-wide events throughout the year to create an even stronger sense of unity -- my preliminary ideas include S’n’Zoo, S’n’Bowling, or just on-campus S’n’Movie Nights. I also take a lot of (possibly too much) pride in my PowerPoint presentation making abilities, so I can promise that GBM will be loaded with relevant information, bad puns, and aggressively creative slide transitions.<br>

I know this was a lot, but I hope it’s clear how much I care about this org and am willing to devote as much time and energy as physically possible to it. I’m very impressed if you made it this far, and thank you so much for reading my platform!
</p>
    <h3>Grace Lazos</h3>
    <p>Scotch’n’Soda is all about making new friends, learning new skills, and gaining new 

experiences. All of these are aspects of a well-run summer camp, and I am a certified and 

trained camp counselor. I have worked at 3 different summer camps, in all different styles and 

with different age groups and backgrounds, so I am well versed in bringing people together to 

get to know each other and achieve a common goal. If elected GMC for the upcoming 2016-17 

school year, I will use my skill set to bring in a diverse new membership, of people of all different 

skill sets and backgrounds, and provide a variety of inclusive activities for our entire 

membership to enjoy. <br>

This past year, I served as Vice President of Membership for Sigma Alpha Iota, Alpha 

Mu chapter, and over the course of my term, I doubled our pledge class size from fall to spring 

semester through my recruitment activities and education plan. My plan is to apply a similar 

model to Scotch’n’Soda, by having our traditional fall recruitment activities, and then follow up 

activities, one per month, that are on campus, so they are easily accessible to the organization, 

and do not require extra transportation planning. <br>

We have our traditional Kennywood Halloween outing, but my plan is to have a 

seasonally- appropriate activity every month. September apple picking, Kennywood in October, 

a potluck in November, and so on. Just fun activities once a month to bring us together as a 

membership to share food, friends, and maybe play some games! <br>

I love making people feel at home, and Scotch’n’Soda certainly has been a home for me. I 

would love to pass that feeling on to new members in my final year at CMU.</p>

    <h3>Tina Vaz</h3>
    <p>Hi members of Scotch! I’m Tina Vaz, a sophomore math major, and I would be honored 

to be your General Membership Coordinator.<br>

Duties of the GMC?<br>

GBM? Let’s do it. I love organizing things. Twice a year you say? No problem! 

Organizing fun events for all? Uhhh yeah. <br>

Kennywood you say? Obviously we need to visit Lord Kenneth Ghostwood, and I would 

also try to get a group discount to lower the price for everyone

A BBQ? Yes yes, good good let us eat and be merry.

New event ideas? I have them!!<br>

- SnSports- Let’s do intermural! Dodgeball anyone? <br>

- SnHangoutSessions- let’s hang out more outside of SnS specific events! Get food <br>

with people, explore Pittsburgh, go to shows (next year is a REALLY good year 

for Broadway shows in Pittsburgh!!), let’s just go get coffee, anything!! I want to 

organize events every week or so to just go somewhere in Pittsburgh, away from 

campus, to unwind from the stress that is CMU. Let’s get to know everyone in 

SnS, not just those who do what you do. Specific ideas -> SnShows, SnMuseums, 

SnMovies, SnFuddle (more often than it already happens), etc.

Goals?<br>

I truly want to unify this org. The divide between the sub-troupes and main-stage show 

members is too large. The discontent between acting and tech is not acceptable. I want to 

run more events so that these divides lessen and we get to know people more, instead of 

just knowing their roles. We need to be able to empathize with others. It causes less stress 

for all of us and will help shows and events run more smoothly. <br>

Qualifications?<br>

Besides my SnS positions, I spent this year as an Etower ambassador, where I planned at 

least 1 event every week. I believe that this last year of scheduling weekly events will 

help me to create events that interest everyone and make SnS an even more enjoyable 

experience. <br>

      <P>I have spent the past year branding Scotch’n’Soda in terms of logo, aesthetic, and 

apparel. If re-elected to this position, I intend to continue this path, as well as working on a few 

other projects. <br>

My main project for the year would be compiling a folder of materials for publicity tech 

heads to use, including logos for every subtroupe, along with the color palette I have been 

working with, and the fonts typically used, as well as a list of necessary information needed on 

each poster and in each program. This will be a resource for anyone who does publicity from 

Tisbert to Mainstage. <br>

My other project is designing/creating Alumni Swag. As we saw from Carnival this year, 

we have a strong and supportive alumni base, and I am sure they would appreciate some 

apparel tailored to them. This can be limited to Carnival sales, but I also would plan on working 

the Webmaster to create an online store to have our merchandise be ordered, if it becomes 

more popular. We can work with Alumni Relations to coordinate this, alongside our Director of 

Development. <br>

I have thoroughly enjoyed getting to exercise my creative skills in this position over the 

past year, and I would be happy to continue doing so.</P>

      <h1>MD Platforms</h1>
      <h3>Adam Lerner</h3>
      <p>Dear Scotch’n’Soda,<br>

For those of you who don’t know me, I am Adam Lerner, a Freshman Business Major and I 

would like to be your next Managing Director.  This season, I have worked on tech crew, stage 

managed, and my largest role was Directing the Carnival Slot main stage show: Legally Blonde.  <br>

I believe that I’ll be the best person for the job of Managing Director because of my experience 

with budgeting and money management as well as my love for and time spent in theatre.  My 

sophomore year of high school, I worked in a small accounting firm over the winter helping 

private clients file income taxes.  My rising senior year of high school, I worked in the Treasury 

department of a large corporation.  There, I was tasked finding and organizing the ~$400 million 

of inventory that their new subsidiary owned. I spent weeks searching for the inventory by 

phone and email, and in the end I was able to get it all warehoused, cataloged, and properly 

recorded in the books.  Using these skills, I can help organize the Scotch’n’Soda inventory and 

make sure that our money is being properly spent and allocated.<br>

I think that I would generally be a helpful and useful board member because of my 

understanding of both tech and the creative process. My experience in theatre was primarily 

tech when I arrived, but since being here I have held small and large roles on both the tech and 

creative side of productions.  I believe that my understanding of tech will be useful in helping 

the board pass production budgets and allocate funding.  <br>

As your Managing Director, one of my primary goals for the year would be to increase budget 

size. In order to achieve this, I will negotiate relentlessly with the JFC to increase our budget for 

the following year. I also plan to set up a system where Scotch’n’Soda can accept tax deductible 

donations in a very easy and simple manor.  I will work with the Director of Development to 

expand our financial relations with alumni.  With extra money budgeted we can afford to be 

more experimental and ambitious with our shows and ideas.  This would give us some wiggle 

room for emergencies and even provide capital for some larger purchases that have been 

pushed off in past years. <br>

Thank you for reading my platform. If you have any questions for me, please don’t hesitate to 

call or text at 914-525-4856, email me at alerner1@andrew.cmu.edu or send me a PM on

      <h3>Emily Broude</h3>
      <p>Hi everyone! For those of you who don’t know me, I’m Emily, a rising sophomore studying 

mechanical and biomedical engineering here at our fine institution. Even though I’ve only been here 

a year, I have a lot of experience with Scotch’n’Soda. I’ve been a tech head four times over, 

including for Tisbert; been on crews in every tech area; participated in NPP workshops and (badly) 

filmed their shows; and assistant stage managed Legally Blonde, which was easily one of the most 

rewarding experiences of my life so far.<br>

I know that the position of Executive Board Member is a pretty nebulous one, but I’m excited to have 

the chance to take it on next year. Mid-production surveys and town halls are often overlooked, but 

to me they’ve become an incredibly valuable part of each production and semester that I’d love to be 

able to keep growing.<br>

As a freshman, I know that entering this org can be a pretty overwhelming experience—you blink 

and all of a sudden you’re the sound board op for Halloween slot—and for some of us, getting 

thrown under the right bus with the right people beside us gives us the chance to fall in love with the 

org and learn at an exponential rate.<br>

But for some, this learning curve is too much, or the way they’ve fallen into the org leaves them 

stuck in one position with no sense of how to learn something different. Whether it be acting, a tech 

area, or even a position on production staff that leaves someone in a rut, everyone in Scotch’n’Soda 

should be able to easily transition between sides of a production and learn about new areas that 

they’re interested in or just don’t know anything about.<br>

This is the part where I start to have ideas, so bear with me. What I’d like to take on as my project as 

your EBM is the creation of an organized mentorship system, where members of S’n’S who love this 

org as much as I do can share their love with new or even longtime members, giving everyone the 

chance to see a new side of what we do.<br>

Through something as simple as a Google form sent out twice a semester (because who doesn’t 

love Google forms?) and a meeting for coffee, new members can learn about what it’s like different 

aspects of a Scotch production without being thrown under that metaphorical bus. Someone who 

has experience acting could learn about being props master, or a Tisbert writer could learn about 

stage management—all with the added benefit of forging connections between members of the org 

who might not otherwise interact and giving our new members a friendly face to say hello to at the 

black chairs.<br>

I’d really love the opportunity to have a greater role in Scotch next year, both as your EBM and a 

general board member—I have a lot of plans for where this org can go and I’m excited to get started 

on all of them. I think I’ll be a steady and unbiased voice on the board, not to mention that my 

original home in S’n’S is in tech, an area that’s traditionally underrepresented on the board and 

deserves a louder voice.<br>

If you have any questions, comments, concerns, thoughts, ideas, general shenanigans, or just want 

to say hi, feel free to reach out to me at ebroude@andrew.cmu.edu or 914-980-3483, or just stop me 

on campus. I’m looking forward to working with you all next year in whatever capacity I can!</p>

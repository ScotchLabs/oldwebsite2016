      <h3>Ryan LaPre</h3>
      <p>LaPré for LaPréz <br><br>

Hey there Scotch’n’Soda, my name is Ryan LaPré, and I am running to be your 

next president. I am a junior Math and Econ major, and I have been involved in 

Scotch since my freshman fall, serving in the past as a Director, Costumes Designer 

and Implementer, a crew member for every one of our crews, a performer, and most 

recently as the Managing Director on the Scotch’n’Soda Board. <br><br>

President of S’n’S is not an easy role to hold, and it takes a steady temper, 

great communication skills, and of course the ability to enable this org to succeed 

and have fun; I believe that I truly fit this bill. I have had continued experience in 

leadership long before I came to CMU, but have continued it here through the 

Student Government (serving as a Student Senate committee chair) and through 

S’n’S. I feel that this experience is crucial in making next year an efficient, positive, 

and really beneficial year for Scotch and our ever-growing membership, and I feel 

that my experience has prepared me well for this challenging role. <br><br>

As president, I would like to address many issues currently facing S’n’S listed 

below, and expanded upon below if you’d like to read:<br>

1. Organizational Transparency and Accountability<br>

2. Development among members<br>

3. A continued community of support for members<br>

Organizational Transparency and Accountability: <br>

One of the major goals of the Board this year is increasing the amount of 

institutional memory and efficient communication we keep, and I think this will 

prove very helpful for future leaders. However, to further help this along, I believe 

having a larger amount of information released to members about our actions as an 

org, and of where we are headed, could be extremely helpful. I believe that in 

addition to the weekly meeting agendas being sent out, we could begin sending out 

brief reports from our Board members, Aux Board members, etc., perhaps once or 

twice per semester with some overall updates. These regular reports could include 

goals for the position in the next few weeks, as well as highlights of the progress 

made in the past few weeks. I feel as though these reports could help inform 

members about our overarching goals of the year, and allowing more opportunities 

for questions as well as feedback from members.<br><br>

Continued Development among members: <br><br>

S’n’S members will never cease to amaze me with their talent and passion for 

what we do, and as president I would strive to support this as much as possible. We 

have made great strides in technical and artistic training for members in the past 

few years, and would like to see this initiative continued, and hopefully enhanced. 

To supplement this effort, I think introducing some materials (similar to current 

leadership transition materials regarding organizational knowledge) to the public 

drive could help further inform S’n’S members of how we operate in the CMU 

community, and allow them to further their impact on S’n’S. Some of this 

information is already around, such as suggestions for proposing shows, or 

production guides, but other aspects of org, such as how technical crews usually 

operate or how we budget for example, have yet to be released in a structured form. 

Having this information, I feel, could help foster helpful conversations about our 

processes, and allow members to become more familiar with them as they step into 

productions, making the transition easier and changes in the process easier to 

A Continued Community of Support for Members: <br>

This org can get very intense, which I believe speaks highly to the passion 

and commitment of our members; but this intense effort can put a strain on 

members. Throughout next year, I’d like to continue fostering support for members 

as we balance our lives here at CMU. Specifically, I’d like to provide support by 

allowing members opportunities to share their opinions and vent their frustrations 

at regular office hours, and through efficient Wrap-Up meetings. Additionally, I’d 

like to push next year’s board to continue advocating for healthy scheduling and 

regular de-stressing activities when possible, as we have in the past through 

Thank you for reading my platform, and I hope you will take your decision of 

voting very seriously. At the end of the day, this position comes down to strong 

vision, good leadership skills, and persistent work to ensure continued success for 

Scotch, and I’d be honored to serve in this role.<br>

If you’d like to discuss any part of this platform further, feel free to reach out

Thanks, and Vote LaPré for LaPréz.<br><br>

      <h3>Grace Lazos</h3>
      <p>This year, we have have made vast improvements in our leadership system, our social 

dynamics, and our overall outlook as an organization. My appreciation and admiration for our 

members’ hard work and dedication has only multiplied as I have watched us grow back to an 

organization of friendship and comradery. We are back on an upswing, and if elected President 

for the 2016-17 school year, I intend to keep us on that path. <br>

There are three main points I will focus on: <br>

● support of membership<br>

● collaboration on campus <br>

● community outreach. <br>

Support of Membership <br>

Our President for this past year, Geneva Jackson, had wonderful organizational tactics 

for our Weekly Meetings and direct communication with our membership. I fully plan on keeping 

her outlined agendas for Weekly Meetings and weekly office hours, but with the addition of two 

aspects: Suggestion Box Discussion and Weekend Office Hours. 

Suggestion Box Discussion would be at the end of each weekly meeting as a part of the 

President’s Board Member Update, and essentially would bring to the attention of the Board 

(and whomever else was in attendance) a submitted suggestion from that week. As 

communication with the general membership is the primary job of the Executive Board Member, 

choosing the suggestion(s) each week could also be a part of their responsibilities.  This will 

encourage our members to use the Suggestion Box more, and give the Board a more direct line 

to our members. <br>

Weekend Office Hours are just another way of providing our members with an 

opportunity to communicate their ideas and concerns. I learned from serving as Vice President 

of Membership for Sigma Alpha Iota-  Alpha Mu Chapter, that providing a number of shorter, 

spread out times for larger groups of people tends to work better than one designated, longer 

time a week. So I would be providing 1.5 hour slots on a few different times of day both during 

the week and on the weekend, so there are more opportunities for the organization to voice their 

thoughts, without the intimidating factor of a scheduled, one on one meeting. 

Lastly, I want to ensure that our members are educated and informed on the structural 

and for lack of a better term, political aspects of our organization. We offer overviews on our 

Board Positions at the beginning of the school year, and then have an Elections Process 

meeting in preparation for the end of the year, but I think that providing more detail and giving 

more advance will promote board transparency and make for a well informed organization. I 

intend on accomplishing this through a “Note from the President” once a month, each month on 

a different aspect. The first of the year after the General Body Meeting would be a “Meet the 

Board!” piece, naming each Board Member and listing their specific responsibilities. The next 

month would be on the Aux Board, and so on. The next semester would be more information on 

the Elections Process and Constitutional information, to prepare early and thoroughly for the 

end of the year elections. <br>

Collaboration on Campus <br>

We began to take on more outside projects this year, with Zahra Center and Polkadots: 

The Cool Kids Musical. This was exciting, and for the most part, successful. I think it is 

important for Scotch’n’Soda to collaborate with other student organizations on campus, in 

mutually beneficial ways, so we form ties and gain support from our campus community. We 

have discussed collaborating with Allies to put on a Drag Show in the past, but we were 

inhibited by time and resource constraints. Beginning this process earlier, and taking steps to 

educate their membership to work with our resources, would take the stress off our membership 

and create a much more enjoyable project. We have a large group of people who may not have 

the time or know-how to work on mainstage productions, so providing smaller-scale, skill-

building board projects would be a great teaching opportunity, and we are a teaching 

organization. This would be something I would be working over the summer to plan, reaching 

out to different heads of student organizations, so we are not rushed to pick a weekend at some 

time with two weeks notice. The rushed nature of our previous projects is where we found a lot 

of stress and lack of volunteers, so by taking early initiative, we can eliminate some of that 

stress. <br>

Community Outreach <br>

There are a number of other universities and amateur theatre companies in our area and 

greater Pittsburgh. I have already reached out to members of the University of Pittsburgh 

theatre group, to brainstorm ideas for future collaboration with their organization. I also plan on 

reaching out to students at Point Park, and educators/employees at Pittsburgh Civic Light Opera 

and CAPA. This would be primarily on a social basis at first, organizing events such as inviting 

the University of Pittsburgh students to our Labor Day BBQ, making plans to attend their shows 

and inviting them to ours, scheduling workshops or masterclasses with the more professional 

organizations. This is something I would collaborate with the General Membership Coordinator 

on, as well as the social committee. The more we reach out, the more resources we will have, 

and more opportunities to put Scotch’n’Soda on the map. <br>

In conclusion, my primary goal with all of these proposed projects, is to be the best face 

of the organization I can be. This group has done so much for me over the past three years, I 

am always happy to give back in any way that I can. I am so glad I have had the experiences I 

did in this organization, because every single one of them has helped me grow as a person, and 

taught me how to be a more effective leader. I have loved dedicating my time to Scotch’n’Soda. 

I elected to be here, and I hope you will elect me. Thank you.</p>

      <h1>VP Platforms</h1>
      <h3>Ryan LaPre</h3>
      <P>LaPré for VP: I’ll be your John Adams <br>

Howdy Scotch’n’Soda, my name is Ryan LaPré, and I am running to be your 

next vice president. I am a junior Math and Econ major, and I have been involved in 

Scotch since my freshman fall, serving in the past as a Director, Costumes Designer 

and Implementer, a crew member for every one of our crews, a performer, and most 

recently as the Managing Director for Scotch.<br>

So you may be asking yourself: why would you want to vote for me for VP? 

Good question! Well, here you go:<br><br>

1. Communication across the Aux Board<br>

I think that with a group as large and varied as the Aux Board, having 

consistent and strong communication is vital. As a result, I’d like to have very 

regular check-ins with the Aux Board, and make these minutes more available to the 

general membership. This would allow more opportunities to see where we’re 

moving as an org, and allow members to ask questions as we move through the year.<br>

2. Board Member and Leadership Experience <br>

One reason I believe I would be a great VP is because of my past experience 

as a Board Member, and my leadership experience across campus. In particular, my 

involvement with Scotch and Student Government has allowed me to learn a lot 

about the workings of the university, and this would help very much in the VP role; 

from general board work to room reservations, I feel thoroughly prepared for this <br>

3. Knowledge across the Org <br>

As VP, one deals with all facets of our org on a first-hand management basis. 

Having worked in pretty much all of our org’s operations at one time or another 

(acting, working with Tech, serving as a tech head, attending NPP workshops, and 

working on Tisbert), I feel as though this is a challenge I could face head-on. 

So that’s me, and why I feel as though I’d be a great VP. Thanks for reading, 

and I hope that you vote for me as VP. <br>

      <h3>Tina Vaz</h3>
      <p>Hi scotchlings! I’m Tina Vaz, a sophomore math major who happens to have a 

theatre problem and I want to be your next Vice President. <br>

I’ve been involved in Scotch’n’Soda since GBM my freshmen fall. I remember 

making the decision to join S’n’S during orientation. It was the casino night and I was 

wandering aimlessly, as I couldn’t find someone to hang out with. One of my OCs saw 

me and invited me over to talk to her friends, all of whom I later learned were S’n’S 

members. That night was one of my favorite nights of orientation. The upper classmen 

who I talked to made me feel so welcome and encouraged me to pursue the technical 

areas of theatre that I was interested in. Later I learned that most of them were actors and 

board members. They didn’t care that I was going to be a part of the tech side of S’n’S, 

they just saw me as a CMU student who was trying to find friends. <br>

So why tell this story? Over the past two years, I noticed that not everyone was as 

welcomed into S’n’S by people of different areas. Tech and acting have this huge divide 

that I am really disappointed by. Tisbert, NPP and Workshopping members can go all 

year without meeting people who do main stage shows. I have listened to tech 

complaining about actors messing up without even knowing who the actor is and the fact 

that they might have had a horrible day. The same goes for actors, where they will blame 

the sound crew for messing up during a run without knowing that this is the first show 

they’ve done and the first time they have had access to the sound board. NPP shows get 

scheduled during other shows and rehearsals. Tisbert doesn’t get as much attendance as it 

could if the entire org showed up. Sometimes, Workshopping gets forgotten as a part of 

our org. While some issues are unavoidable, the reactions throughout the org as a result 

of these are not. <br>

Throughout the last two years, I have worked as a props master, a house manager 

and been on pretty much every crew at least once. I actively try to meet the actors when I 

work on a show. I try to go to every Tisbert show and NPP show. I’ve been to 

workshopping events. I am always amazed at the dedication and energy that people put 

into this org, yet I am also astounded that they don’t put energy into meeting people who 

do different things in S’n’S. We are all members of the org that describes itself as “a 

social group with a theatre problem,” yet I think we’ve lost this over the past few years. 

You may be thinking, but what else does the VP do? Well, besides achieving 

personal goals, the VP is in charge of room reservations for the year and working with 

the sub troupes. Can Tina reserve a room? Yes, I can do this. What if something goes 

wrong? I am on good terms with the UC staff, and I believe that I can communicate 

effectively with them if things ever take a turn for the worse. Ok, but what about the sub 

troupes? I have a great appreciation for what they do and I will actively work to 

communicate with the aux board to know and understand the challenges they face and 

how to most effectively deal with them. <br>

In conclusion, I believe that I would be a good Vice President. I am passionate 

about this org and I am driven to make it be as unified as we can be. I believe that my 

ability to separate my personal and professional lives, communicate effectively and 

empathize with others will help me become an effective and successful board member. I 

miss the warm, openness of upper classmen who helped a scared, lonely freshmen 

become the loud, obnoxious Tina you know (and hopefully kind of like?). I have made no 

other commitments besides classes, and I know I can handle the time commitment. If I 

were elected, I would put my heart and soul into making S’n’S become more unified as a 

whole. <br>

<h3>Maggie Davis</h3>
<p>Who?<br>
I’m Maggie Davis and I’m running for Vice President!  I’m a rising senior majoring in Decision Science and minoring in Gender Studies.  I started doing Scotch’n’Soda in my freshman year and have refused to stop ever since!<br>
 
Qualified?<br>
-Duh-doy!<br>
-       -Artistic Director of Tisbert for 2 years<br>

-       -Been to every Auxiliary Board meeting in those two years<br>

-       -Familiar with both NPP and Workshopping<br>

-       -I can book a room like a pro, lemme tell yah<br>

 
Why?<br>
I want to be Vice President to help my babies shine.  I’ve been involved in subtroupes from the very beginning of my time at CMU.  Tisbert, NPP, and Workshopping are all close to my heart.  All of them have come so far in only the three years I’m been here and I couldn’t be more proud. I want to see them continue to grow and flourish.  In addition, I think the other position of the Aux Board: Webmaster, Historian, and Director of Development don’t get nearly as much recognition as they so rightfully deserve.  I want to help bring them into the limelight and help them grow.<br>
 
Goals?<br>
One of my main goals as Vice President would be to help those lesser known positions on the Aux Board shine.  I plan to work with the Director of Development to make alumni relations a larger part of the org.  I hope that this year, we can get people excited about our various alumni and keep our org updated about them just as much as updating them about us.   
Also, I hope to help Workshopping continue growing.  Chris and Russell have made huge strides in enhancing the subtroupe, but it’s still on its way.  I plan to assist workshopping in holding more events and getting more people, including actors, directors, and tech people involved in the process and events.  I think by holding more events like Whatsherface, that get so many people invested in involved, I can help Workshopping continue it’s radical upward momentum.<br>
Overall, I want to beef up our already awesome Aux Board and I look forward to working with the members to come up with and implement creative ideas to do that.</p>

<h3>Grace Lazos</h3>
<p>Our subtroupes and Auxiliary Board have made impressive strides in strengthening their

membership and individual projects. If elected as Vice President for the upcoming 2016-17 

school year, I will work to ensure the continuation of the strong bond between the general 

organization and these branches, as well as work to create programs and plans to support the 

future of our organization. <br>

The board has discussed adding a new member to the Auxiliary Board similar to the Director of 

Technical Training, a Director of Artistic Training. The position would essentially be to help train 

new directors and actors in the organization, running a New Director Workshop once a 

semester, very similar to the one Sophia Emmanuel created during the 2014-15 school year. 

The premise was creating directing pairs of new interested directors, and pairing them with a 

directing mentor to work on a scene. My thought is to take this model, and to pair it with an 

excellent idea that Brianna Hudock had and shared with me: to have the Workshopping 

committee have a showcase at the end of each semester to display the new works created. The 

new directors would be assigned a scene written by one of our workshoppers halfway through 

the program, after receiving background instruction on the different aspects of directing a show. 

The Director of Artistic Training would also schedule a series of acting workshops for 

prospective new actors, to prepare them to audition for the scenes. About halfway through the 

semester, the new directors would be assigned a scene written by the workshoppers, and would 

hold auditions. This would be a smaller-scale, lower-stakes way of training new directors and 

actors for the organization, so the same people do not keep directing, and our actors do not get 

burned out. <br>

In a similar vein, this sort of program implementation could be used by the Director of 

Technical Training. We had different presentations this year from all areas of tech, both design 

and implementation, but they only offered one opportunity, and little hands-on experience. In 

this model, the prospective tech heads in each area would be assigned a show, and would have 

a team of one person from each area designing an overall cohesive concept for their assigned 

production. For implementation, obviously large-scale sets and props could not be built, but 

smaller models/deliverables could be created and displayed in the case on the second floor of 

the UC. <br>

We are primarily a teaching organization, and by giving more opportunities to learn and 

develop skills will keep us functioning smoothly for years to come. It is incredibly gratifying to 

display newly developed skills and well done work, so providing an outlet for every one of our 

subtroupes and programs to be highlighted in is a great way to show appreciation for our 

membership.</p>
      <h1>Artistic Director Platforms</h1>
      <h3>Dani Joseph</h3>
      <p>Why do you want to be AD?<br><br>
I have loved seeing the growth S’n’S has done over the past year and being a part of each production process by serving on the board. Watching rehearsals and engaging with all members of the org always inspires me and makes me proud to be a member. I would love to take a more active role in the artistic process by becoming AD and guiding new members towards a greater understanding of their art. 
A problem we ran into this year was there were many amazing proposals that were just not right for the org at the time. Using my extensive dramatic experience, I would make sure to guide people who were proposing these types of shows towards proposals that would better fit the amazing people in S’n’S. I read so many scripts every week that this would not be difficult and would allow for a more well-rounded year for everyone involved. <br><br>

Why are you qualified to be AD?<br><br>
I have been fortunate this year to watch current AD Sophia Emanuel run an efficient and thoughtful deliberation room, give frequent updates on show successes and hiccups, and refine the artistic force in this org. My experience watching Sophia has taught me a lot about how to be an AD, which would allow me to sidestep many of the pitfalls of being a first-time AD. 
Additionally, as AD, I would use my skill set as a dramaturg to make sure that we pick shows that fit the wonderful people in this org. I read scripts all the time as a School of Drama student and could point proposers to good shows. Additionally, I’m familiar with many different rehearsal processes and directing styles due to my experience, which would make me an adaptable AD able to work with any show process. <br><br>
Lastly, dramaturgs have to work closely with directors. I know how to speak any director’s language due to my 14 years of theater experience, including taking Directing 1 in the School of Drama last year, Graduate Directing this year and directing 12 Angry Women in high school. In addition to this, I am a rounded candidate for AD because I have lots of experience in virtually all aspects of the the theater. I have acted since I was 5, I have directed, I have worked behind the scenes in costumes and lighting, and this year I did my best to attend technical trainings (though I’m still scared of the miter saw). I can talk intelligently to anyone in this org about what they’re trying to accomplish, which is important in an AD. <br><br>

What’s your platform?<br><br>
My platform is threefold: <br>
  1. Teaching: Theater Bootcamp<br>
I want to host a training week at the beginning of each semester so people can learn new skills and improve existing skills. I would work with experienced members of this org to lead workshops in acting, how to look at a script (for any area of S’n’S), directing, choreography, music directing, and writing. This would not only allow this org to become a teaching and learning org again but ensure that when senior classes graduate we aren’t left without experienced lowerclassmen. Additionally, this is a low-pressure way for inexperienced members of the university to get involved with the S’n’S family. <br>
  2. Accountability: Check Me Out<br>
I would keep an open, running Excel checklist of everything I needed to do for each show so everyone can be on board with the artistic process. This will allow everyone in the show (and even people outside of it within the org) to understand where in the process the show is and have an accurate timeline to complete their own work. <br>
  3. Approachability: Hang With Me<br>
I would serve as AD with humility, making sure to hold office hours so people can approach me at any time with their ideas and talk to me about any concerns they have about the artistic side of the org. Additionally, I would be able to hit the ground running due to my board experience. I will not be a part of any S’n’S productions next year, so I could serve as AD all year round. <br><br>

If you have any questions about my platform or ideas, please ask me any questions or email me! I would love to hear from you. </p>
      <h3>Maggie Davis</h3>
      <p>Who?<br>
I’m Maggie Davis and I’m running for Artistic Director!  I’m a rising senior majoring in Decision Science and minoring in Gender Studies.  I’ve been in S’n’S since Fall of my freshman year and have been active and loving it ever since!<br><br>
 
Qualified?<br>
Yes!<br>
-       -Served as Artistic Director of Tisbert for 2 years<br>

-       -Directed The Outsiders and co-directed Tisbert’s #town<br>

-       -Assistant Directed Bloody Bloody Andrew Jackson, Guts, and Tisbert’s Love Bites<br>

-       -Performed in main stage and Tisbert<br>

-       =Been on Hair & makeup crews for multiple shows<br>

-       -Attend S’n’S performances regularly<br>

-       =Have been involved with theater for 11 years<br>

 
Why?<br><br>
I want to be Artistic Director because I love to direct and I love to teach.  I’ve had the awesome opportunity to work on five shows as a director in the past year.  I’ve been able to learn the ropes and implement them successfully with the help of past Artistic Directors and other amazing members of this org.  Now, I want to help others do the same.  I want to help more people in this org become directors and I’m so excited to work with a variety of people with a variety of fabulous visions.  Also, I believe that with all of my experience, I’ve established myself as a valuable leader in this organization and would love to extend that to the Board and be a voice in the room where it all happens.<br>
 
Goals?<br>
I want to make some physical resources for directors.  In working with Sophia and other directors in the past, one of the big things that stands out is that there is no one right way to direct.  I plan to create a binder that contains a variety of helpful materials for directors.  I want to include warmups, different methods of planning a rehearsal, blocking methods, various character exercises, and ways to maintain control and calm in a rehearsal room.  My goal is to include lots of these documents that directors can take with them, or even just look at and to have such a variety that there is something for every unique director and unique vision.  I believe creating a physical, organized way for directors to find the specific resources they need would help ready their own arsenal and make them more prepared and confident in the rehearsal room.<br>
Additionally, I’m excited to work with the Vice President and the rest of the board in the creation of the new position of Director of Artistic Training.  This position would hold trainings and workshops for directors and other artistic positions in the board.  This will help nurture a vast community of directors in Scotch and I couldn’t be more excited to help make that happen.
More than anything though, I’m excited to learn, grow, and help us put on amazing shows together!<br>

      <h1>GMC Platforms</h1>
      <h3>Heather Graci</h3>
      <p>I got to CMU in September and went to the fall GBM, and was instantly intimidated by the overwhelming amount of love in the room. Everyone seemed to know and genuinely enjoy each other already, and in most other groups of people, that makes it extremely difficult for new members to start feeling comfortable. In my past experiences with joining clubs and organizations and the like, groups tend to be inherently exclusive -- people gravitate towards the friends they already have, and newbies are left to fend for themselves. This experience was the polar opposite. Scotch‘n’Soda may truly be the most welcoming organizations I’ve ever been a part of. Older members told me to audition for shows and go to NPP workshops having barely even met me, told me all about their own experiences with the organization, and went out of their way to say hi to me around campus (and saved AnnaJamieson Beck and I when we got hopelessly lost in the middle of the night on our first weekend here -- we are forever in Darrin Willis’ debt).  This is the epitome of what I love about S’n’S. The org harbors a very genuine “all for one and one for all” mentality, which is an incredibly special thing to be a part of.<br>

This is the main reason I’m running for GMC. Scotch‘n’Soda is genuinely the reason I’ve had such a wonderful first year at CMU, and I want to help maintain that experience for both current and future members. Serving as GMC of the org would give me the opportunity to help foster the welcoming, loving atmosphere which is the main reason I spend an embarrassingly large number of hours at black chairs every day. It’s extremely important to me that new members feel as welcome and encouraged as I did when I first got here, as well as that existing members continue to feel valued and embraced by the organization. <br>

I’m very comfortable with public speaking and I love engaging with people one on one, so I feel like I have a lot to offer in terms of connecting with and recruiting new members. The relationships I’ve formed with existing members of the org will also help me in taking on this position, as I have access to a wide variety of opinions and experiences regarding what they value about S’n’S. I know how to make people feel comfortable, I’ve never been described as shy, and I love bringing people together. Between my specific qualifications and my connections within S’n’S, I genuinely feel that I have a lot to bring to the table in order to make the org even better than it already is. As much as I joke around and have fun, making sure things run smoothly and efficiently is extremely important to me. Hence, event organization can be very high stress, but I love doing it and things generally work out well. I’d love to organize even more organization-wide events throughout the year to create an even stronger sense of unity -- my preliminary ideas include S’n’Zoo, S’n’Bowling, or just on-campus S’n’Movie Nights. I also take a lot of (possibly too much) pride in my PowerPoint presentation making abilities, so I can promise that GBM will be loaded with relevant information, bad puns, and aggressively creative slide transitions.<br>

I know this was a lot, but I hope it’s clear how much I care about this org and am willing to devote as much time and energy as physically possible to it. I’m very impressed if you made it this far, and thank you so much for reading my platform!

    <p>Scotch’n’Soda is all about making new friends, learning new skills, and gaining new 

experiences. All of these are aspects of a well-run summer camp, and I am a certified and 

trained camp counselor. I have worked at 3 different summer camps, in all different styles and 

with different age groups and backgrounds, so I am well versed in bringing people together to 

get to know each other and achieve a common goal. If elected GMC for the upcoming 2016-17 

school year, I will use my skill set to bring in a diverse new membership, of people of all different 

skill sets and backgrounds, and provide a variety of inclusive activities for our entire 

membership to enjoy. <br>

This past year, I served as Vice President of Membership for Sigma Alpha Iota, Alpha 

Mu chapter, and over the course of my term, I doubled our pledge class size from fall to spring 

semester through my recruitment activities and education plan. My plan is to apply a similar 

model to Scotch’n’Soda, by having our traditional fall recruitment activities, and then follow up 

activities, one per month, that are on campus, so they are easily accessible to the organization, 

and do not require extra transportation planning. <br>

We have our traditional Kennywood Halloween outing, but my plan is to have a 

seasonally- appropriate activity every month. September apple picking, Kennywood in October, 

a potluck in November, and so on. Just fun activities once a month to bring us together as a 

membership to share food, friends, and maybe play some games! <br>

I love making people feel at home, and Scotch’n’Soda certainly has been a home for me. I 

would love to pass that feeling on to new members in my final year at CMU.</p>

    <h3>Tina Vaz</h3>
    <p>Hi members of Scotch! I’m Tina Vaz, a sophomore math major, and I would be honored 

to be your General Membership Coordinator.<br>

Duties of the GMC?<br>

GBM? Let’s do it. I love organizing things. Twice a year you say? No problem! 

Organizing fun events for all? Uhhh yeah. <br>

Kennywood you say? Obviously we need to visit Lord Kenneth Ghostwood, and I would 

also try to get a group discount to lower the price for everyone

A BBQ? Yes yes, good good let us eat and be merry.

New event ideas? I have them!!<br>

- SnSports- Let’s do intermural! Dodgeball anyone? <br>

- SnHangoutSessions- let’s hang out more outside of SnS specific events! Get food <br>

with people, explore Pittsburgh, go to shows (next year is a REALLY good year 

for Broadway shows in Pittsburgh!!), let’s just go get coffee, anything!! I want to 

organize events every week or so to just go somewhere in Pittsburgh, away from 

campus, to unwind from the stress that is CMU. Let’s get to know everyone in 

SnS, not just those who do what you do. Specific ideas -> SnShows, SnMuseums, 

SnMovies, SnFuddle (more often than it already happens), etc.

Goals?<br>

I truly want to unify this org. The divide between the sub-troupes and main-stage show 

members is too large. The discontent between acting and tech is not acceptable. I want to 

run more events so that these divides lessen and we get to know people more, instead of 

just knowing their roles. We need to be able to empathize with others. It causes less stress 

for all of us and will help shows and events run more smoothly. <br>

Qualifications?<br>

Besides my SnS positions, I spent this year as an Etower ambassador, where I planned at 

least 1 event every week. I believe that this last year of scheduling weekly events will 

help me to create events that interest everyone and make SnS an even more enjoyable 

experience. <br>

I have the design experience, the social media skills, and the S’n’S love to be an awesome Public Relations Coordinator and hype the heck out of Scotch ’n’ Soda!<br>

I have a minor in the School of Design here at CMU and I’ve taken many graphic design courses. This past year, I was the lead designer for TEDxCMU, and I've been the lead designer for several award winning hackathon projects. I'm very passionate about good design. <br>

I also ran the TEDxCMU Twitter and Facebook accounts and I'm good with social media in general. I have experience as Technical Director managing publicity designers, which is important for the Public Relations Coordinator position.<br>

I care a lot about S'n'S and I would love to contribute to the organization by being on the board and doing what I love, which is design and social media!<br>

      <P>I have spent the past year branding Scotch’n’Soda in terms of logo, aesthetic, and 

apparel. If re-elected to this position, I intend to continue this path, as well as working on a few 

other projects. <br>

My main project for the year would be compiling a folder of materials for publicity tech 

heads to use, including logos for every subtroupe, along with the color palette I have been 

working with, and the fonts typically used, as well as a list of necessary information needed on 

each poster and in each program. This will be a resource for anyone who does publicity from 

Tisbert to Mainstage. <br>

My other project is designing/creating Alumni Swag. As we saw from Carnival this year, 

we have a strong and supportive alumni base, and I am sure they would appreciate some 

apparel tailored to them. This can be limited to Carnival sales, but I also would plan on working 

the Webmaster to create an online store to have our merchandise be ordered, if it becomes 

more popular. We can work with Alumni Relations to coordinate this, alongside our Director of 

Development. <br>

I have thoroughly enjoyed getting to exercise my creative skills in this position over the 

past year, and I would be happy to continue doing so.</P>

      <p>Money is a tool, lets use it wisely<br><br>

Hello!<br>

I'm Jacky Lao, and I'm going to be a sophomore MSE student for 2016­17. I've been in

S'n'S for a year now, and I'm running to be your Managing Director.

In my scant one year of S'n'S, I've been<br>

• Assistant Stage Manager for Bloody Bloody Andrew Jackson<br>

• Set Designer for Bang Bang Banality<br>

• Assistant Production Manager for The Outsiders<br>

I hope it's clear that managing, whether it's a cast, a production, or a tech team, is

something I'm great with.<br>

First and foremost, the Managing Director has to handle the budget.

At this point in time, recent developments such as the SnS public drive are a great

resource for people that want to get quick and simple rundowns on doing the jobs in their

positions. Procedures for reimbursement, purchasing, creating tech budgets, and so on,

are generally taught but never written down. I want to simplify procedures and make the

lives of future S'n'S members easier.<br>

With regards to the endowment, I want to maintain it's position as an emergency fund, to

support the absolute essentials of each production. I believe it's something we need to

preserve and not waste.<br>

Second, while my experience in Scotch and Soda has been relatively limited, in my

management positions, I've met and learned from many of the veterans. I have

experience in many aspects of theatre and the Scotch and Soda community. As for what I

don't know, I'm am perfectly willing to ask for help from someone who does to make sure

that everyone leaves satisfied.<br>

Third, Scotch and Soda is growing, and with the recent UC developments, and the new

theater, the organization is going to have a major overhaul with how we operate. I want

everyone to be assured that I will be willing to hear all of your opinions on the matter.<br>

Finally, my qualifications. All of the positions I've held in shows in Scotch'n'Soda have

required major amounts of organization and time management skill. Furthermore, I check

my email regularly and respond promptly.<br>

Feel free to message, email, or say hi when walking by on campus if you have any

questions about my platform!

      <h3>Adam Lerner</h3>
      <p>Dear Scotch’n’Soda,<br>

For those of you who don’t know me, I am Adam Lerner, a Freshman Business Major and I 

would like to be your next Managing Director.  This season, I have worked on tech crew, stage 

managed, and my largest role was Directing the Carnival Slot main stage show: Legally Blonde.  <br>

I believe that I’ll be the best person for the job of Managing Director because of my experience 

with budgeting and money management as well as my love for and time spent in theatre.  My 

sophomore year of high school, I worked in a small accounting firm over the winter helping 

private clients file income taxes.  My rising senior year of high school, I worked in the Treasury 

department of a large corporation.  There, I was tasked finding and organizing the ~$400 million 

of inventory that their new subsidiary owned. I spent weeks searching for the inventory by 

phone and email, and in the end I was able to get it all warehoused, cataloged, and properly 

recorded in the books.  Using these skills, I can help organize the Scotch’n’Soda inventory and 

make sure that our money is being properly spent and allocated.<br>

I think that I would generally be a helpful and useful board member because of my 

understanding of both tech and the creative process. My experience in theatre was primarily 

tech when I arrived, but since being here I have held small and large roles on both the tech and 

creative side of productions.  I believe that my understanding of tech will be useful in helping 

the board pass production budgets and allocate funding.  <br>

As your Managing Director, one of my primary goals for the year would be to increase budget 

size. In order to achieve this, I will negotiate relentlessly with the JFC to increase our budget for 

the following year. I also plan to set up a system where Scotch’n’Soda can accept tax deductible 

donations in a very easy and simple manor.  I will work with the Director of Development to 

expand our financial relations with alumni.  With extra money budgeted we can afford to be 

more experimental and ambitious with our shows and ideas.  This would give us some wiggle 

room for emergencies and even provide capital for some larger purchases that have been 

pushed off in past years. <br>

Thank you for reading my platform. If you have any questions for me, please don’t hesitate to 

call or text at 914-525-4856, email me at alerner1@andrew.cmu.edu or send me a PM on 

Facebook (Adam Lerner).</p>

<h3>Alexandra Halberstadt</h3>
<p>Hi everyone!<br>

My name is Alexandra, and I am a stage manger for Scotch’n’Soda (my majors are 

psychology and biology, but SMing is my passion). The skills I have gained from 

stage managing are easily transferable to the area of MD. I am very organized, and 

am quick to respond to emails. I am also very adaptable to different situations 

(because what is stage managing if not being calm and collected in a lot of different 

situations?). I would easily be able to keep track of all the information relating to the 

budget, and I can communicate with adults and students in a professional and 

confidential manner. <br>

Organization and attention to detail are half the battle, and the other half 

(knowledge of spending policies) I will work hard to learn during the transition 

process. I have the capacity to be an effective and professional MD, and I would like 

the opportunity to show my skills in this position. I strive to be easy to talk to, and in 

this position I hope to promote openness about the budget and what can and cannot 

be done. I will promptly respond to all inquiries and make sure people feel 

comfortable voicing their concerns with me. <br>

As a member of the board, I will bring a keen eye for detail and an experienced 

voice. I have seen four Scotch’n’Soda shows from start to finish, and I know how the 

show process works. This knowledge of how S’n’S performs will help me make 

decisions that benefit the org as a whole. <br>

Please feel free to contact me if you have any questions about any part of my 

platform :) (ahalbers@andrew.cmu.edu or 704-430-8440)<br>

<h3>Keaton Shapiro</h3>
<p>Hey there Scotchlings,<br>
 
For those of you whom I have not yet met, I’m Keaton Shapiro, a rising senior working on a BHA in Linguistics and Dramaturgy who once minored in Psychology and then remembered that theatre is more fun. <br> 
 
Throughout my three years at CMU and two and half with SnS, I have been involved in eight main stage productions, four Tisbert shows, and was once a member of NPP. I’ve been on production staff, I’ve been a tech head, and I’ve been on every crew except sound and lighting. I am also currently a member of Dungeon Staff as Props Tech Area Head. I think I can safely say that I have a wide range of experience within this organization.<br>
 
So why do I want to be your next Managing Director? Why would I be good at it? What have I done to earn your trust? Let’s get into it.<br>
 
Because of the way our organization functions, I believe a strong relationship with the Student Activities and CUC staff is crucial.<br>
 
I have spent the last year and a half working as a Financial Assistant in the Office of Student Activities. If you have ever filled out one of those blue reimbursement requests and gotten your check in the mail, you’re welcome, I made that happen. I also make student organization purchases on my PCard, and last year oversaw PCard audits for all student activities staff as well as for the students we advise. Before working as a financial assistant, I was the office assistant in Student Activities for a year. As a result of my long employment with Student Activities, I not only have very close relationships with all of the staff members, but I also have a very clear and in-depth understanding of Student Activities policies, both financially and in general.<br>
 
In addition to my work in Student Activities, I work with the CUC staff as a Supervisor, meaning I take over when Stan leaves (yes, the Stan). This again entails a strong understanding of what is expected of us as an organization, as well as a good relationship should anything not go according to plan, like, hypothetically, getting fake blood on the floor of Connan.<br>
 
Being a board member, however, requires more than just know how in your specific position, it requires an understanding of the org as a whole. As I mentioned above, I have been very involved in SnS and have loved every minute of it; even while I was kvetching, there was no place I’d rather be, and I mean that honestly. SnS reminded me of how much and how deeply I love theatre, in any and every aspect. I’ve been on multiple production staffs, hair and makeup tech head a few times, and tried my hand at (almost) every crew. I have made myself a part of scotch at every level I could, and continue to strive for the full experience. I love this organization more than anything I’ve done at CMU and only want to make it better.<br>
 
My goal as managing director is to make the process easier by making it all clearer. Scotch’n’Soda has been striving, throughout my time here, to make our processes more transparent. While we have definitely been moving in the right direction, I think there are still some areas in which the waters are a little muddy, leading to confusion rather than ease. One of these areas is budgeting. The first time I had to make a budget I had no idea what I was doing. The second time, I still had no idea what I was doing. This year, when advising props heads, their first questions were, “how do we make a budget?” I’d like to make this part of the process clearer for tech heads by not only meeting with the TD on a production, but also being available and strongly recommending a meeting with me for first time tech heads to figure out the budgeting process.<br>
 
On a larger scale, I’d like to make it clearer to the organization how our financial systems work. Without getting into it here, I think that there is a lot more that can be learned by all members of the organization to aid with spending during shows and an understanding of why we work the way we do.<br>
 
Ultimately, and as I’ve stated, I love this organization with my whole heart. I can’t wait to see what new, great things we create next year, and am so very proud of all of the work we have put up this year.<br>
 
Thank you so much for reading all of this, and I hope you consider me for your next Managing Director.

      <p>Hi everyone!<br>

My name is Alexandra Halberstadt, and I am a freshman (rising sophomore) biology 

and psychology major. But, most of you know me as a stage manager! As a stage 

manager, I have a lot of experience effectively communicating with members of the 

production staff and the cast by sending prompt and thorough emails. I also have a 

lot of experience taking minutes, and I am very confident in my ability to fulfill the 

role of secretary. I am organized (as anyone who has seen my color-coded planner 

can attest to), and I would love to use my communication skills to help the org.<br>

But, secretary is not just about taking notes and being organized. It is also about 

being an active member of the board. I have seen four shows go from start to finish 

in Scotch’n’Soda (BBAJ, Bang Bang Banality, Zahra, and Legally Blonde), and I know 

what it takes to make a great show. My position on the board would be to make sure 

everything the org does is well documented, and communication is as efficient and 

open as possible. This will help to make S’n’S the best it can be. <br>

Feel free to contact me at ahalbers@andrew.cmu.edu or 704-430-8440 if you have 

any questions about my platform or how I would perform as secretary.  <br>

<h3>Thomas Nakrosis</h3>
<p>Thomas Nakrosis – Secretary “A Secretary is not a toy – Mr. Bratt” <br><br>

Hi! I’m a sophomore in Decision Science and I’m honored and humbled to have been nominated to the 

Board. I’ve been in S’n’S since my freshman year, and in that time have been involved in almost 

everything we do an org. I’ve acted (Bang Bang Banality), SM’d (How 2 $uceed), PM’d (Motherfucker 

with the Hat), Directed (Bloody Bloody Andrew Jackson), done hard and soft tech (Master 

Electrician/Hair and Makeup Chief for Merrily/Legally Blonde), been around NPP’s workshops and wrote 

for 3 shows of Tisbert. I’m also the Tech Area Head for Lighting/Electrics.<br>

As a board member I would use this experience, and the general knowledge of S’n’S and its members to 

help create a place that everyone loves. As this year has shown anyone, regardless of age or experience 

is able to join and find their home and success in S’n’S and I think it’s a credit to this board that this is 

the case, and something we can double down on in the next year and future years to come. This year 

has been such a success because of the experience of our board members and the passion of our 

members, and I like to think I am old enough to be experienced, but not old enough to be dusty (yet).<br>

Specific to the role of Secretary I’ve served as the clerk of the Undergraduate Student Senate, a role 

identical to Secretary in that I take and distribute minutes and encourage the general flow of 

information through the Senate, for the past three semesters, so I am experienced in the type of work 

that the Secretary would be called upon to do.</p>

      <h1>TC Platforms</h1>
      <h3>Thomas Nakrosis</h3>
      <p>Technical Coordinator “Only thrown out of the Dungeon twice”<br><br>

Hi! I’m a sophomore in Decision Science and I’m honored and humbled to have been nominated to the 

Board. I’ve been in S’n’S since my freshman year, and in that time have been involved in almost 

everything we do an org. I’ve acted (Bang Bang Banality), SM’d (How 2 $uceed), PM’d (Motherfucker 

with the Hat), Directed (Bloody Bloody Andrew Jackson), done hard and soft tech (Master 

Electrician/Hair and Makeup Chief for Merrily/Legally Blonde), been around NPP’s workshops and wrote 

for 3 shows of Tisbert. I’m also the Tech Area Head for Lighting/Electrics.

Tech this year has been amazing, from putting the Blood in Bloody Bloody to building a two story 

wheeling platform tech has continued a grand legacy of lighting actors and not dropping props. That 

being said it is also possible to improve, something I would try to do by increasing training in areas that 

are considered “specialized” (light, sound, scenic), increasing the actor-tech relations, and increasing our 

tacit knowledge. <br>

Firstly, it might sound impossible to create more people who know sound and lights, but as lighting TAH 

I can say that’s exactly what happened. The lighting crew for Legally Blonde was 1500% larger than the 

lighting crew for Merrily we Roll Along, and while a lot of that is that the organization grew as a whole 

some of that is the careful way the board, especially Andy and his love of sound, helped create an 

environment where people felt comfortable trying out these “specialized” fields. As TC I would continue 

to foster this attitude to further grow tech in S’n’S.<br>

Actor-Tech relations are fine. That’s it. They’re alright, dandy, mediocre and that’s not an issue, but it is 

an area we can improve. The best way I can think of to do that is to have several small opportunities for 

people to step outside of their comfort zones and try acting if they’re generally tech or vice versa. I 

imagine that a small, one night open mic style event where people can perform little scenes or 

monologues is 1000% less imposing for someone who has never acted to try than even say May Slot. I 

think that having the opportunity to try being on the other side of the curtain from where you usually 

are will give everyone in the org (who wants it) a better understanding of tech and acting.<br>

Lastly I want to increase our tacit knowledge, and the best way to do that is to get as many people 

involved in tech as possible. I want to restart the drill training at the beginning of load ins, as I think it 

was a good way for people to get a feel that they were contributing directly to the set that was being 

built. Additionally I would transition the wiki (and its wealth of contact info and advice) onto our newer 

Google Drive Platform, as the information has been slowly forgotten since we don’t use the wiki now. 

Also as a board member more generally I would leverage my experience across the different facets of 

the org to offer the best, most concise and actionable notes and advice. I would also hold hours to meet 

with members of the org, and generally bum around at black chairs so I’d be reachable.</p>
      <h3>Michael Wagner</h3>
      <P>Hey! I’m Michael! I have thoughts about how Tech in this Org can be 

improved! The three topics I talk about here are general tech knowledge, technical 

training, and tech moral, but I also have plans to improve AB tech relations, improve 

key card accesses and increase actor/tech relations.<br>

One of the things I’m most interested in achieving for next year is 

maintaining and passing down the general tech knowledge of this organization. As a 

tech head and technical director, speaking with people who have held those 

positions in the past has been integral in me performing my job in the best way I 

could. As Technical Coordinator, I’d strive to compile information on which 

technical aspects have worked well in past shows in order for future TDs and tech 

heads to have at their disposal when deciding on which design / implementation 

choices to make. These would be resources for TDs and tech heads to either follow, 

or learn from in order to do things differently in future shows. We all tell a lot of 

stories about what has worked in the past, but having actual constructive 

information about the technical challenges of the past would be extremely useful for 

our future. This would also go for how to structure the main technical aspects of our 

organization, namely tech head selection, designer / implementer interactions, and 

load-in / strike organization. Information on how these have been run in the past 

(and the problems with specific instances) can be useful for future shows in order to 

make everything reliable, safe, efficient, and happy.<br>

Along similar lines, I want to improve the technical training program for tech 

heads. This year have had a huge influx of freshman tech heads. This has been 

wonderful for us as an organization, but one thing we can work on is making sure 

new tech heads feel prepared for the (oftentimes large) task of being a tech head. 

Our technical training program has been a tremendous step forward on training 

new techies, but I feel we can do a lot more in order to help new tech heads succeed. 

One relationship that I would strive to make more pronounced is the relationship 

between tech heads and dungeon staff. Dungeon staff should not only be in charge of 

maintaining the dungeon, but also as mentors in their area to tech heads throughout 

the show process. This should involve dungeon staff being present at builds and 

other activities in order to help give guidance to tech heads if asked. I’m also 

interested in maintaining a more stable training / mentoring system for designers 

(mainly scenic, lighting, and publicity). These are some of the areas we have 

struggled with the most since I’ve been here, and I feel there needs to be more of a 

system in place for designers to learn how to design for a Scotch ‘n’ Soda show.<br>

My final goal for tech is to improve the Tech persona and Tech moral for 

Scotch ‘n’ Soda. For those who know me well, I’m generally a pretty happy person. I 

really love doing tech with S’n’S and while it is oftentimes stressful, I want to make 

sure that the stress of doing a show never gets in the way of anyone having fun. We 

all should be making sure that we reach out to each other to get help when we need 

it, and remember to always care for one another. I think there a bunch of small 

things we, as tech, can do to improve our moral, and I believe that we are all capable 

of putting on amazing shows while having a wonderful time doing so. <br>

from sunshiney New Jersey. Say what? You’re already in the School of Drama? But 

Krissy, you’re already spending a crazy amount of your time doing theater things, why do 

a darn thing with S’n’S? Well, pals, I’ll tell you. I decided to audition for Bloody Bloody 

this fall because I knew that I’d miss performing, and I quickly fell in love with every one 

of you. From your dedication to theater, to your creativity, to your commitment to putting 

on the best show possible, it was clear this was an organization I wanted to be a part of. 

What I love about this org is that it was immediately so welcoming and that everyone 

works so hard to create a comfortable environment for individuals from every discipline. 

Not only this, but everyone is made comfortable to experiment artistically and reach out 

of their comfort zones. It is this exact type of environment that I hope to perpetuate, to 

foster, and to further.<br>

So far in S’n’S I have performed in Bloody Bloody, dramaturged Bang Bang, assistant 

costume designed for The Outsiders, and I’m currently a part of the reading of 

Whatsherface. I have additional experience performing in musicals and plays, assistant 

directing, directing, and producing. I believe that this experience will allow me to 

understand the broadest range of production elements as productions go on, and to help 

encourage new opportunities and positions on productions. <br>

I also believe that my diverse experiential background in both theater and film will allow 

me to produce an innovative and experimental board project that stems from the passions 

and wills of the entire organization. I look forward to having the opportunity to help 

members of our organization realize productions they may have never thought possible, 

and experiment with work that may not typically fit into our season. <br>

I am in love with both organization and structure, and will do all in my power to make 

sure that our org runs as smoothly as possible. I will also strive to prioritize the creation 

and development of innovative work throughout the year. I believe there are a number of 

valuable voices that are currently silent in our organization, and I hope to change this by 

improving points of contact between board members, production leaders, and all 

members of the organization.<br>

I am very passionate about all voices being heard and ensuring that every individual in 

S’n’S has a positive and productive experience because, after all, at the end of the day, 

we really are just a social organization with a theater problem</p>

      <h3>Emily Broude</h3>
      <p>Hi everyone! For those of you who don’t know me, I’m Emily, a rising sophomore studying 

mechanical and biomedical engineering here at our fine institution. Even though I’ve only been here 

a year, I have a lot of experience with Scotch’n’Soda. I’ve been a tech head four times over, 

including for Tisbert; been on crews in every tech area; participated in NPP workshops and (badly) 

filmed their shows; and assistant stage managed Legally Blonde, which was easily one of the most 

rewarding experiences of my life so far.<br>

I know that the position of Executive Board Member is a pretty nebulous one, but I’m excited to have 

the chance to take it on next year. Mid-production surveys and town halls are often overlooked, but 

to me they’ve become an incredibly valuable part of each production and semester that I’d love to be 

able to keep growing.<br>

As a freshman, I know that entering this org can be a pretty overwhelming experience—you blink 

and all of a sudden you’re the sound board op for Halloween slot—and for some of us, getting 

thrown under the right bus with the right people beside us gives us the chance to fall in love with the 

org and learn at an exponential rate.<br>

But for some, this learning curve is too much, or the way they’ve fallen into the org leaves them 

stuck in one position with no sense of how to learn something different. Whether it be acting, a tech 

area, or even a position on production staff that leaves someone in a rut, everyone in Scotch’n’Soda 

should be able to easily transition between sides of a production and learn about new areas that 

they’re interested in or just don’t know anything about.<br>

This is the part where I start to have ideas, so bear with me. What I’d like to take on as my project as 

your EBM is the creation of an organized mentorship system, where members of S’n’S who love this 

org as much as I do can share their love with new or even longtime members, giving everyone the 

chance to see a new side of what we do.<br>

Through something as simple as a Google form sent out twice a semester (because who doesn’t 

love Google forms?) and a meeting for coffee, new members can learn about what it’s like different 

aspects of a Scotch production without being thrown under that metaphorical bus. Someone who 

has experience acting could learn about being props master, or a Tisbert writer could learn about 

stage management—all with the added benefit of forging connections between members of the org 

who might not otherwise interact and giving our new members a friendly face to say hello to at the 

black chairs.<br>

I’d really love the opportunity to have a greater role in Scotch next year, both as your EBM and a 

general board member—I have a lot of plans for where this org can go and I’m excited to get started 

on all of them. I think I’ll be a steady and unbiased voice on the board, not to mention that my 

original home in S’n’S is in tech, an area that’s traditionally underrepresented on the board and 

deserves a louder voice.<br>

If you have any questions, comments, concerns, thoughts, ideas, general shenanigans, or just want 

to say hi, feel free to reach out to me at ebroude@andrew.cmu.edu or 914-980-3483, or just stop me 

on campus. I’m looking forward to working with you all next year in whatever capacity I can!</p>
<h3>Alexandra Holberstadt</h3>
<p>Hi scotchlings!<br>

I am Alexandra Halberstadt, and you might have seen me around as a stage manager 

for four of the shows this year. I have a lot of theater experience (I’ve been a part of 

25 shows in the last 5 years) and a passion for theater. I would love to be part of the 

board as the EBM and to help this org in any way I can. 

What are my main priorities as EBM? <br>

-Information availability: I want to increase the usage of the S’n’S google drive, so 

that any new members can learn how to be better tech heads/TDs/SMs, etc. I want 

to ensure that anyone can find information or mentors if they want to learn more 

about different areas of putting on a show. I want to connect more TAHs with 

implementers during shows so that all members feel they have someone to help 

them along in the process.<br>

-Approachability: As a member of the board I want people to feel free to voice their 

concerns about any part of the org. I will continue to appoint a cast liaison to the 

board, to make sure that everything is going smoothly during productions, and to 

have town halls where everyone can have an opinion. 

Thank you for your consideration, and feel free to contact me at 

ahalbers@andrew.cmu.edu or 704-430-8440 if you have any questions about my 

platform. <br>

-Alexandra :)</p>

<h3>Thomas Nakrosis</h3>
<p>EBM – “Like EDM only less shitty”<br><br>

Hi! I’m a sophomore in Decision Science and I’m honored and humbled to have been nominated to the 

Board. I’ve been in S’n’S since my freshman year, and in that time have been involved in almost 

everything we do an org. I’ve acted (Bang Bang Banality), SM’d (How 2 $uceed), PMDirected (Bloody 

Bloody Andrew Jackson), done hard and soft tech (Master Electrician/Hair and Makeup Chief for 

Merrily/Legally Blonde), been around NPP’s workshops and wrote for 3 shows of Tisbert. I’m also the 

Tech Area Head for Lighting/Electrics.<br><br>

As EBM one of the major responsibilities is to create that responsibility. I have several ideas that could 

fill that void. First is a comeback for the new directors workshop that happened last year. We could 

learn from the experience, make it more hands on and work on creating an experience that would really 

help people who wanted to direct gain insight, not only in how to direct, but how to direct with S’n’S. 

One of the issues with the EBM has been the creep into the Artistic Director’s role that the position has 

experienced in past years. I can’t fault the passion of our past EBMs but would conceive of the role 

differently. As EBM I would focus on reaching out to the org and spearheading the newest ideas that 

come out of it. As with my proposal to bring back the new director workshop I would be a voice and 

resource for people in the org who have new ideas and want to pursue them. <br><br>

Also without stepping on the toes of the GMC and in coordination with the PRC I would work on 

expanding our outward face and name recognition in two ways. First would be in recruitment on 

campus, especially during the first weeks of the new year but also during each of our new show cycles, 

to make sure that everyone knows that they are welcome in S’n’S if they ever have an inkling to join. 

The second would be through partnerships with other groups on campus and in the greater Pittsburgh 

community. By enhancing our ties with the School of Drama (such as our props rentals) and with other 

collegiate theater groups in the area (looking at you Pitt Musical Theater Club) I would want to make 

S’n’S’s shows not just a campus-wide event, but a city-wide one. As grandiose as this sounds so did our 

current President’s idea that we could one day call ¼ of all CMU students current or former member’s, 

but in the span of a year that goal now looks obtainable. I think that’s the most magical part of S’n’S, we 

can do these things (and theater too).</p>
